/**
 * A hidden input that carries a value the visible component never submits.
 *
 * A component that renders no `<input name>` of its own — a rich text editor, a
 * canvas picker, a third-party combobox — is invisible to FormData. Rather than
 * pulling its value into React state and fighting it back out at submit, park
 * the value in a hidden input and let the form collect it like any other.
 *
 * A component rather than a props helper for two reasons the form cannot see
 * from outside: React updates a controlled value without any DOM event, so a
 * change here has to be announced with one for rules and `isDirty` to notice;
 * and a controlled input's defaultValue tracks its value, so the value it
 * mounted with is burned into `data-initial` as the dirtiness baseline.
